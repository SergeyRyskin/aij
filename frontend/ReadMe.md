Creating a face recognition app using Mediapipe and JavaScript involves several steps. Here's a brief overview of the process:

Set up a development environment: To get started, you need to have a text editor, a web browser, and Node.js installed on your computer.

Install the necessary libraries: You'll need to install the Mediapipe and TensorFlow.js libraries to build the app.

Set up the HTML file: Create an HTML file and add the necessary code to set up a canvas element where the video and facial landmarks will be displayed.

Load the video stream: Use the getUserMedia API to load the user's webcam stream and display it on the canvas.

Use Mediapipe to detect facial landmarks: Use the FaceMesh module of Mediapipe to detect and track the user's facial landmarks.

Use TensorFlow.js to train the model: Train a TensorFlow.js model to recognize the user's face based on the facial landmarks detected by Mediapipe.

Implement the recognition algorithm: Write a JavaScript function that takes the facial landmarks as input and outputs the name of the person in the video stream.

Display the output: Display the name of the recognized person on the canvas.

```html

    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <script src="app.js"></script>

```

> JavaScript

```js
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

const video = document.createElement('video');
video.width = canvas.width;
video.height = canvas.height;
video.autoplay = true;

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: true})
  .then(stream => {
    video.srcObject = stream;
    video.play();
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });

const faceMesh = new FaceMesh({locateFile: (file) => {
  return `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/face_mesh/${file}`;
}});
faceMesh.setOptions({
  maxNumFaces: 1,
  minDetectionConfidence: 0.5,
  minTrackingConfidence: 0.5
});

faceMesh.onResults(results => {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  ctx.drawImage(video, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  const landmarks = results.multiFaceLandmarks[0];
  // Use the landmarks to recognize the face
});

const camera = new Camera(video, {
  onFrame: async () => {
    await faceMesh.send({image: video});
  },
  width: canvas.width,
  height: canvas.height
});
camera.start();
```

This code initializes a canvas element, loads the webcam stream, and initializes the FaceMesh module to detect and track facial landmarks. You can use the landmarks to recognize the user's face and display the output on the canvas.


Here's the same code as above, but written in TypeScript:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Face Recognition App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```


```ts

import { FaceMesh } from '@mediapipe/face_mesh';
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs-core';
import * as tfjsWasm from '@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm';
import { Camera } from './camera';

tfjsWasm.setWasmPaths('/tfjs-backend-wasm/');
tfjsWasm.setWasmPath('/tfjs-backend-wasm/tfjs-backend-wasm.wasm');
tf.setBackend('wasm');

const canvas: HTMLCanvasElement = document.getElementById('canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;
const ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D = canvas.getContext('2d') as CanvasRenderingContext2D;

const video: HTMLVideoElement = document.createElement('video') as HTMLVideoElement;
video.width = canvas.width;
video.height = canvas.height;
video.autoplay = true;

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: true})
  .then(stream => {
    video.srcObject = stream;
    video.play();
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });

const faceMesh = new FaceMesh({locateFile: (file: string) => {
  return `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/face_mesh/${file}`;
}});
faceMesh.setOptions({
  maxNumFaces: 1,
  minDetectionConfidence: 0.5,
  minTrackingConfidence: 0.5
});

faceMesh.onResults(results => {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  ctx.drawImage(video, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  const landmarks = results.multiFaceLandmarks[0];
  // Use the landmarks to recognize the face
});

const camera = new Camera(video, {
  onFrame: async () => {
    await faceMesh.send({image: video});
  },
  width: canvas.width,
  height: canvas.height
});
camera.start();

```

The main changes are adding type annotations to the variables and function parameters, and importing the necessary libraries using import. The Camera class is imported from a separate file, which is not shown here.

To run the TypeScript code that uses Mediapipe and TensorFlow.js, you will need to install the following packages:

@mediapipe/face_mesh: this package provides the FaceMesh module for detecting and tracking facial landmarks.

@tensorflow/tfjs-core: this package provides the core functionality of TensorFlow.js, including tensor operations, model loading, and training.

@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm: this package provides a WebAssembly backend for TensorFlow.js, which allows it to run on the browser without requiring a GPU.

ts-node: this package allows you to run TypeScript code directly from the command line.

typescript: this package provides the TypeScript compiler, which is needed to compile TypeScript code to JavaScript.

You can install these packages using npm, the Node.js package manager. Open a terminal window and run the following command:

````console
npm install @mediapipe/face_mesh @tensorflow/tfjs-core @tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm ts-node typescript
```

Once the packages are installed, you can run the TypeScript code using ts-node by running the following command:


```console
ts-node app.ts
```

This will compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript and run it in the Node.js environment. Note that you may need to adjust the import paths in the TypeScript code to match the file structure of your project.
